# Questions 
# Q1: Could we have done it the other way around, first using symmetric
# encryption and then switching to asymmetric encryption? Explain your
# answer.
# A1: It could have been done but sending encrypted messages would be a lot slower with the asymmetric encryption.
# Encrypting the secret and public keys wouldn't make sense because the public keys are already shared or known 
# and the secret keys wouldn't need to be shared.

# Q2: What do you think of the security of the system? Do you think thereâ€™s
# any possible attack? If so, describe it and explain how we could prevent it.
# A2: We think the system is very secure as we are using asymmetric encryption to share the key needed to decrypt 
# the message but if we use a nonce which is too short or repeats it's digits it would be easier to crack and also
# if we use too short public or secret keys it is also a security hazard as the encryption would be cracked way easier
